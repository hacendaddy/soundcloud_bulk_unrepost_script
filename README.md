# Soundcloud bulk unrepost tool
A script meant to help unreposting fast the soundcloud songs from your profile.

Steps are simple:
1. Copy the js script in the shell.
2. Open your soundcloud profile
3. Press F12 and go to console
4. Paste the script as plain text if the browser doesn't let you copy
5. Change setInterval if it stops, the faster it is the easier it will be for soundcloud to block so many requests.

Enjoy.
